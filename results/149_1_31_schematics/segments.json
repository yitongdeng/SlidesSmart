"Segment 1: \"i like to think about three pieces of blocks in any modern processor\", which refers to the conceptual breakdown of a processor's functional components.\n\nSegment 2: \"one of them which i'm always going to color orange throughout this class\", which introduces the first component of a processor, designated by the color orange.\n\nSegment 3: \"is about control figuring out like it's managing where we are in the instruction stream\", which describes the control unit's role in instruction management.\n\nSegment 4: \"and figuring out once i get the next instruction what do i do\", which further explains the function of the control unit in processing instructions.\n\nSegment 5: \"then i have this yellow box\", which introduces the second component of a processor, designated by the color yellow.\n\nSegment 6: \"which is responsible for the arithmetic maybe adding some numbers or carrying out a move or multiplying some numbers\", which describes the arithmetic logic unit's (ALU) functions.\n\nSegment 7: \"and i'm always going to call that yellow\", which emphasizes the color designation for the arithmetic component.\n\nSegment 8: \"and then i have stuff that's blue\", which introduces the third component of a processor, designated by the color blue.\n\nSegment 9: \"that's state\", which identifies the blue component as related to the processor's state.\n\nSegment 10: \"and i'm calling this the execution context\", which defines the blue component as the execution context of the processor.\n\nSegment 11: \"it's the context in which we run a program\", which explains the execution context as the operational environment for programs.\n\nSegment 12: \"which is just a big set of values of bindings from register one has this value register two has this value as well as memory has all these values\", which describes the execution context as a collection of values in registers and memory."
